e Data Source API (Application Programming Interface) allows you to integrate other software in your enterprise with Plex by making requests to a set of data sources.

Data sources available in the Data Source API are like wrappers for stored procedures that perform one or more related tasks. Calling a data source through the API is like executing a stored procedure and is recorded as a data source transaction.

Obtain access credentials to call a data source
To request a new developer account to access the Data Source API, contact Plex Customer Care.

Note
If you have a developer account for using Plex Classic Web Services, use those credentials for the Data Source API.

Definitions
credentials
A combination of a username and password used to authorize API requests.
data source
A wrapper for a stored procedure that performs one or more related tasks. Calling a data source through the API is like executing a stored procedure and is recorded as a data source transaction
environment
Data sources can be called in two environments:

Production: the live environment where your organization's data is updated in real time.
Test: a copy of the live environment that is used for trying out new features or testing functionality, including API requests.
global allow
A field on a data source that is managed by Plex and indicates if a web service user account can be granted access to execute it.
json (JavaScript Object Notation)
A standard way to format data that is shared between two systems. It is easy for humans to read and write, and can be easily parsed by computers.
self serviceable (data source)
A data source that can be granted access to a web service user account to execute through HTTP or within Process Flows.
transaction
A combination of a single request to a data source and the response returned.

Identify a data source
Use the Data Sources screen to search for and view the available data sources in Plex and their corresponding IDs.

Open the Data Sources screen.
Adjust the filters, and click Search.
Locate the data source in the Data Source Name column and note the ID in the ID Column. This is the ID to use in the request when calling this data source using the HTTP protocol.

ID - The ID of the data source; use in the request when calling this data source.
Data Source Name - Name of the Data Source, with the corresponding database name in parenthesis ( ). For example, Action_Type_Get (Part), where Action_Type_Get is the name of the Data Source, and Part is the name of the database.
Data Source Type - Stored Procedure is the most common type.
Inputs - The number of inputs that are part of the request.
Outputs - The number of outputs that are part of the response.
Module Group - The module group to which the data source belongs.
Module Name - The name of the module to which the data source belongs.
Self Serviceable - If checked, indicates that a web service user account within your tenant can be granted access to execute the data source.
Global Allow - If checked, indicates that the data source has been preapproved to be self serviceable if its assigned module is turned on in the tenant.
Select a row and click Details on the Action Bar to view additional information.
The Data Source Detail screen appears with information for the data source that you selected, including specific input and output information.
Grant a web service user access to a data source
To grant access to a data source, one of the following scenarios must be true:

Scenario 1	Scenario 2
Your tenant must already have a web service account granted access to that data source.
The data source is Plex-owned, not community-owned.
The data source must have the Global Allow flag turned on.
The data source must have a module (and module group) assigned to it.
Your tenant must have the same module turned on.
Open the Web Service Access By User Account screen.
Adjust the filters, including selecting a User Account.
Click Search.
In the grid, locate the data source(s) to which the specified user account in the filter should have access.
Click the box in the Granted column.
Click the Apply button at the bottom of the page.
Request access to a data source
If you see a data source on the Data Sources screen but not on the Web Service Access By User Account, contact Plex Customer Care to review your requirements.

Use the Data Sources screen to identify the Data Sources to which you need access.
Have your Plex Champion submit a case to Plex Customer Care to request access to the Data Sources.
Request web service user account
Contact Plex Support to request a new web service user account to execute data sources through the HTTP protocol or within Process Flows.

Using metadata endpoints to get data source information
Updated: 2022-03
Use the following endpoints to retrieve metadata for data sources from Plex.

Note: Higher level text formats are all returned as strings, including XML and HTML.

Date strings always include time data while time strings are more like stop watch values.
Retrieve a list of data sources to which you have access
Request
GET /api/datasources/search?name=

Response
The response will be a list of all of the data sources to which your user account has access. Contact Plex to request access to other data sources.

Search for data source by name
Search for data sources that contain a match on the name string.  This returns an array of simplified header records.

Create an authorization header
Create a BASIC Authorization header using your credentials from Plex. Contact Plex Customer Care to request a developer account.

The following is a sample header using UTF-8/Base-64 encoding:

var credentials = username + ":" + password;                  // Your user account credentials
var bytes = utf8GetBytes(credentials);                        // Standard library in most languages
var encodedCredentials = base64Encode(bytes);                 // Standard library in most languages
var authorizationHeaderValue = "Basic " + encodedCredentials; // Authorization header value
Set the HTTP method
Each call to the Data Source API requires the POST method.

Set the HTTP headers
Construct the HTTP header using the following guidelines for the request and response.

Header

Value

Status

Description

Accept

application/json

Optional

Defines JSON as the response media type. This is implied by the Content-Type header, however Plex does not support alternative response types at this time.

Accept-Encoding

gzip, deflate

Recommended, Multiple

Defines a list of acceptable encodings that can be used when sending the HTTP response from the server to the client.

Plex recommends using gzip,deflate for its efficiency.

Authorization

Basic {encodedCredentials}

Required

See the Authorization Header.

Content-Type

application/json; charset=utf-8

Required

Defines JSON as the response media type. This is required.

The charset is implied as UTF-8.

When using this Content-Type, the response will be in the same media type.

Building the request body
The Data Source API uses JavaScript Object Notation (JSON).

Optional Indentation
Specify pretty=true on the query string of your execution requests.

Without the option, or when specifying "pretty=false", the response body will contain compact JSON without whitespaces between JSON tokens. This is the default behavior.

With the option, the response body will use newlines and 2-space indent between JSON tokens.

Note
This formatting feature can be used with the default request/response format or any explicit override. It is independent of structure.

Request
POST /api/datasources/1791/execute?format=2&pretty=true
